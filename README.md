# EMS Black Book

This app is designed to help Cambridge veterinary students in their clinical years keep track of the skills they need to learn during EMS placements.\
Data for the skills is taken from the Vet School's "Black Book" - a checklist of recommended skills for students to learn. This app just presents that checklist in a (hopefully) more convenient format.\
Data for the appendix page of this app is taken from the same document and contains healthy reference ranges for a variety of clinical tests, among other advice.\
Written in Dart using Flutter.
